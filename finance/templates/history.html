<!--
Complete the implementation of history in such a way that it displays an HTML table summarizing all of a user’s transactions ever,
listing row by row each and every buy and every sell.
For each row, make clear whether a stock was bought or sold and include the stock’s symbol, the (purchase or sale) price, the number
of shares bought or sold, and the date and time at which the transaction occurred.
