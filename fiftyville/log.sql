-- Keep a log of any SQL queries you execute as you solve the mystery.
-- First query to see what tables are included:
.tables

airports              crime_scene_reports   people
atm_transactions      flights               phone_calls
bakery_security_logs  interviews
bank_accounts         passengers

-- Second query to take a look at the crime scene report table:
SELECT description
  FROM crime_scene_reports
 WHERE month = 7
   AND day = 28
   AND street = "Humphrey Street";
    /*Theft of the CS50 duck took place at 10:15am at the Humphrey Street bakery.
    Interviews were conducted today with three witnesses who were present at the time â€“
    each of their interview transcripts mentions the bakery.
    Littering took place at 16:36. No known witnesses.*/

-- Crime scene report mentions interview logs and bakery so the following queries were ran next:
  .schema interviews
  -- to get interview logs:
  SELECT name, transcript
    FROM interviews
  WHERE month = 7 AND day = 28 AND transcript LIKE "%bakery%";

/*                                                         |
|Eugene| I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery,
I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.
                                                                                      |
|Raymond| As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the
thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other
end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket. |

|Emma| I'm the bakery owner, and someone came in, suspiciously whispering into a phone for about half an hour. They never bought anything.*/
.schema bakery_security_logs

  -- Thief is definitely one of these as was seen getting into car within this time frame, according to interview transcripts:
  SELECT activity, license_plate, hour, minute
    FROM bakery_security_logs
  WHERE month = 7 AND day = 28 AND hour = 10 AND minute BETWEEN 15 AND 30;
  -- Check when witness Eugene got to the bakery as he saw thief just before that by an ATM:
  .schema people
  SELECT activity, hour, minute
    FROM bakery_security_logs
         JOIN people
           ON bakery_security_logs.license_plate = people.license_plate
    WHERE name = "Eugene";
