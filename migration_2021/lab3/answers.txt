sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: Bubble sort has a lower bound running time of Ω(n) making it faster than merge sort when the data set is already sorted.
                  Sort 1 performs either faster or just slightly slower than sort 2 when sorting the sorted.txt files.


sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: It is clearly the fastest overall of the three programs when running the different types of files.
                  With a running time of Ө (n log n) merge sort is faster than the other two sorting types.


sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: By process of elimination and the fact that the it has the slowest lower bound running time of Ω(n2) in the best case scenario
                  of an already sorted data set. In all 3 types of .txt files, regardless of size, sort 3 took the longest time to sort them.
